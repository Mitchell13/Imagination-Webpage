              I was born and lived most of my childhood in the town of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher,_North_Carolina">Fletcher</a>, North Carolina
              which is nestled in the mountains of the western part of the state. Having two loving
              Christian parents and a selfless older sister I grew up in a blissful environment.
              As a child, I would spend countless hours in my imagination; imagining myself as the
              star of a sports team, an inventor, a powerful business executive, or even the president
              of the United States. Imagining what I could be or what I could create was one of my favorite things.
              While my friends would spend their time playing video games or texting friends,
              I would rather spend my time imagining the future and the countless possibilities it could hold.

              As I reached the end of my senior year of high school, the time for me to decide what
              I was going to study in college was fast approaching. I didn’t know exactly which path to choose,
              but I decided to study something in the realm of business because of the wide-ranging possibilities
              that the area of business provides. Throughout my college experience I developed friendships with
              a wide range of new people and strengthened my existing friendships with my former high school classmates.
              As my college days were unfolding, my imaginative spirit continued.
              Though college made time a precious commodity, I would still spend time imagining
              what the future could hold. As my college experience was winding down the big decisions
              of deciding where to work and where to live where looming overhead. To get a better feel
              for the different options I decided to do an internship – with the hope that it would
              help me figure out what area of business I enjoyed most.

              Currently, I am working as an accounting intern for a hospital system in Fort Worth, Texas.
              Accounting is a field based on rules and protocol. It is also very repetitive – being based
              on a monthly cycle. Almost everything that my colleagues and I do is done on the computer.
              Just like times past, my imagination started running on how this job could be done in a more
              efficient manner. Then the idea came - following rules and protocol along with performing routine
              tasks are areas where computers excel. Computers have already transformed the way that accounting
              and business operations have been done once before, but now the time seems ripe for a second transformation.
              It seems as if the processes in place can be significantly improved and automated.
              However, I lack the computer skills needed to solve this problem. That is one of the reasons
              why I have started learning the basics of coding in an attempt to better be able to address
              and improve worker productivity.

            My future is currently enshrouded with uncertainty. On the one hand, I could continue on my
            current trajectory towards a career in business/healthcare. On the other, I could step out
            into the unknown by pursuing more of a computer/technological career path. From my imaginative
            standpoint, pursuing a career in a technological area seems to have more limitless potential
            and be much more exciting. However, I am still a long way from having the skill set needed to be competent in the
            technological arena. Whichever path I choose and wherever I end up in the future, I hope
            to have a significant impact on society to make this world a better place.
